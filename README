This PHP script is designed to be run as a daily scheduled task (e.g. using cron). It downloads a list of Twitter followers for a given Twitter ID, and then compares the list against names stored in a MySQL database. If a follower isn't found on the list it will update the database and display a message.

The createTable.sql file contains the required SQL table definition. The script isn't very robust - if it isn't possible to retrieve the Twitter followers for some reason then it will claim that no-one is following you and wipe the database - but rerunning the script when Twitter is back up will restore the database.

I've updated the script to work with the latest version of Twitter's API. It makes use of the twitteroauth library which can be found at https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth.
